[tf-media.net]() - Archive Viewer
===============================

In 2011, the transformation story and caption site tf-media.net has been closed. It was a collection of novels and captioned images centering around various transformations. On very notable feature of the site was its *Choose your own Transformation* section, where the reader could traverse an interactive story.

When the site closed for good, an admin put a partial database export on the net, to hopefully allow continuation of this great community-driven project at a later point.

I'm starting this project in github in 2020, because I feel many good storytelling works have been lost in over nine years.

This is not intended to be a new platform for contribution, however it is meant to be a viewer for all the great works, discontinued or not, that deserve to be read and enjoyed again.


for readers
-----------
You have two options. You can either
1. [download the archive for offline reading]() or
2. [view it in browser]()

Option 1 is recommended, since the archive is big and will possible use up a lot of your data plan.


for authors
-----------
You have been an author at tf-media.net? That's great, and I thank you on behalf of all the readers.
The database dump only contained the usernames from tf-media.net, so there was no way to contact you and inform you of my project. I'm sorry for that, but I believe it is also in your interest these stories are available again.

If you still have a blog yourself, it would be nice if you could advertise this project a bit.



for contributors
----------------
At this point there is no possibility to contribute by writing new chapters, stories or captions. I'm open for suggestions, but the only way I see a contribution is to merge the database export into a similar site.

If you are administering a similar site, you can contect me anytime and I will happily discuss your ideas and offer my contribution.



for developers
--------------
Obviously I am not a software engineer, but learned a bit of coding here and there. If you think my code or my approach at all is unelegant, I'm open for your ideas and suggestions.

If there are issues, feel free to report them, so the reading experience can be as smoth as possible.
